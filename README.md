# CALLING ALL BSS PLAYERS !!

Heya! Have you ever played bee swarm, and then wanted to make a pony of your favorite character? But then you realized "where would I even use such a pony!! Bee swarm fans are hard to come by in this day and age..."

WELL !! DO WE HAVE GOOD NEWS FOR YOU!!! Me ( @d1sc0o ) and my two friends, Dani ( @W1lloww ) and Blue ( @XxBlueberryxX2009 ), are looking to set up a fandom area for bss!! However, we can't just have three people there! So, If you or your friends enjoy bss and want to meet people who also like it, come join us! We'll be one safe server one, below hermit hill / mcyt area. Here's a photo of the location and the spot on the map. Can't wait to see fellow beekeepers there ^^
